  title: "About"
  content: >       
    My name is Ferran Mart√≠nez and I'm a PhD. Student based in Barcelona. If I 
    had to describe myself, I would say that I'm a passionate person that loves 
    robotics, artificial intelligence and the idea of pushing the knowledge of 
    humanity to a further level.<br><br>
    
    Aside from my job, I like to read (both technological or non technological stuff)
    and different kind of competitions (robotics competitions, hackatons and so on). 
    That helps me to learn technologies outside my main research interests (like 
    web development!), be a more polivalent developer and develop the projects
    that come to my mind.<br><br>
    
    In my free time I like to go to museums and expos, hit the gym, play guitar 
    or just trying to go outside my comfort zone.

      date: "September 2021 - Now"
      info: "As PhD. Student at IRI my job is related to improve the current 
      knowledge in social robotics. The idea is to study how to use social robots
      in public spaces, which includes topics like which are the best techniques to
      allow communication with humans in noisy environments, how to protect user 
      information, how to notify a user that its information is being stored and
      so on."

      date: "November 2018 - March 2021"
      info: "As a Software Engineer at Datision my main task was to work on 
      industrial projects related to Artificial Intelligence. The idea was to use 
      AI to automatize processes, detect defects and failures in production lines 
      and similar tasks. In general the projects were based in SQL databases, Django 
      servers as backend and React applications as frontend, while AI sections
      were done with Tensorflow + Keras or Scikit-Learn, depending if Deep Learning 
      or Machine Learning was used."

      date: "June 2017 - October 2018"
      info: "As an intern at IRI I helped in both robotics competitions and technology 
      transference projects under the supervision of the Perception and Manipulation lab. 
      In both cases the technological stack was based on ROS and Python, combining robotics
      work with AI (mostly Computer Vision with Keras + Tensorflow)."

      date: "March 2016 - November 2016"
      info: "As a developer at ArgosBPM, I was in charge of developing Javascript 
      scripts for ARIS platform, in order to raise user experience while working 
      with BPM processes. In addition, I helped to maintain the servers in which 
      ARIS was running, and I gave tech assistant to different kind of clients."
