The idea of having an impossible list is something that I’ve seen in a lot of web pages, most of them based on [Thomas Frank](https://collegeinfogeek.com/about/meet-the-author/my-impossible-list/) impossible list. In my case, I think that as everybody I always have a lot of plans that due to being risky, expensive or hard to plan I tend to push to the future indefinitely.

However, as one grows older it is easy to see that having time in the future is not something that it is going to happen forever, so taking action **now** is something desirable. That is the idea of having an **impossible list**: force myself to think about the things that I want to do in my life, write them down and make steps in order to fulfill them.

This list, therefore, changes over time, because as we succeed in one goal we are going to think in the next one. _Being aware of our goals allows us to think on the next steps to follow in life_.
